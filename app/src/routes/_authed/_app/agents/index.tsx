/*
 * The roster wraps on the width it actually has, not on the window's.
 *
 * A card is a fixed 144px, so four fixed columns overlap the moment the column they sit in is
 * narrower than the card. That is not a narrow-window case: opening the detail pane takes the width
 * out of this column at any window size, so the cards behind an open Bot overlapped each other on a
 * perfectly ordinary screen. `auto-fill` tracks the container instead, which is the thing that
 * actually changed.
 *
 * The tracks are the card's own width, not `minmax(144px,1fr)`. A `1fr` track stretches to share
 * the container while the card inside it stays 144px, and the difference reads as a gap: at prose
 * width that was three 190px columns holding 144px cards, so the 15px gutter looked like 61px.
 *
 * Both grids are block children of their section, and they have to be. `auto-fill` needs a definite
 * width to divide into tracks; a grid placed inside a `flex flex-row` is a flex item sized
 * shrink-to-fit, so `auto-fill` has nothing to fill and resolves to a single column. That is what
 * put "Your agents" in a one-card column while "Explore agents", whose grid was never wrapped,
 * flowed correctly three across on the very same page. Do not reintroduce a flex wrapper here to
 * position the roster.

   *
   * `isPending` rather than `agents === undefined`, and the difference is the whole point on a
   * screen whose job is to say when there is nothing. `data` is also undefined when the query
   * FAILED, so deriving the flag from it holds the screen in its loading branch forever on an
